Completing a PhD based around the quantitative analysis of risk for UAS ("drones"). Proven design and manufacturing experience with extensive programming, machine learning and data science knowledge, and strong teamwork and leadership abilities. Specialties are agent based simulation and distributed/scalable C++, particularly using the Repast libraries. Particular interest in Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) and Autonomous Aerial Systems.

Very likely to be flying, you can find me in the air in the [University glider](https://sugc.net/) [here](https://glideandseek.com/?aircraft=DD508A) or you can peruse my previous cross-country flights [here](https://www.weglide.org/user/11591).

When the weather isn't playing ball, I'll probably be tinkering with my [Ender 5 Pro](https://www.crealityofficial.co.uk/products/ender-5-pro-3d-printer) 3D printer, [out for a run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/26067436) or fixing whatever I have broken on my HomeLab server...
