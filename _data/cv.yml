      description:
        - Delivered multiple Machine Learning/AI research projects by mining open Big Data sets 
        - Prototyped models using well-known Python libraries (Pandas, Dask, SKLearn and TensorFlow) in Jupyter Notebooks
        - Implemented leading Anomaly Detection algorithms (Active Isolation Forests, LODA and Support Vector Machine) from scratch in C# .NET as class libraries for integration with main codebase 
        - Prototyped several Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures (Bi-directional LSTM, GRU, NARX and Clockwork RNN) for marine traffic trajectory prediction
        - Created Literature Review and full documentation for code with use cases and future projects/roadmaps

      description:
        - Represented the University at high stakes events such as Open Days. Undergone training to ensure adherence to Competition and Marketing Authority regulations
        - Inspire and inform prospective students and parents in ‘drop-in’ events where any questions can be asked. This requires me to think on my feet and draw on my knowledge of the engineering courses and options oﬀered by the University as well as my own experiences
